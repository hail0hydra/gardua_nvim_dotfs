# Neovim Dot-files

This repository contains Neovim config files for both Linux and Windows-based environments. 

## Features

### 1. Basic Options

- I have set basic options like `tabstop`, `relative number`, etc., which you can find [here](lua/options.lua).
- This also includes fetching two color schemes: [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) and [material](https://github.com/kaicataldo/material.vim/).

### 2. Lazy.nvim

- [`Lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is a new plugin manager for Neovim, replacing the now deprecated [`packer`](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
- The setup file for this plugin is [here](lua/plugin.lua), and the list of plugins to be installed is mentioned [here](lua/pluginlist.lua).

### 3. LSP (Language Server Protocol)

- Neovim comes with built-in LSP support, enabling features like code suggestions, autocompletions, etc. The setup for this is [here](after/plugin/lsp.lua).
  - **Snippets:** With LSP and language servers installed using [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim), I also utilize [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for autocompletion, whose setup is [here](after/plugin/cmp.lua).

### 4. Telescope

- Telescope makes navigation, file finding, and searching for keywords in entire projects very easy. The setup is [here](after/plugin/telescope.lua).
  - I've also used the [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin for syntax highlighting and more.

### 5. Discord RPC Integration

- Additionally, I've integrated [nvimcord](https://github.com/ObserverOfTime/nvimcord) to enable Discord Rich Presence in Neovim. This feature enhances collaboration and showcases your activity to others on Discord.
- To update your Discord Rich Presence, open and edit a file in Neovim, then press `Esc` to enter normal mode. Type `:nvimcordupdate`, then press `Tab` and `Enter` to update and display your Rich Presence on Discord.
